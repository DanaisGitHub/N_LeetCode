## Description
You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is the weight of the ith stone.
We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose the heaviest two stones and smash them together. Suppose the heaviest two stones have weights x and y with x <= y. The result of this smash is:
At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.
Return the weight of the last remaining stone. If there are no stones left, return 0.

## Examples

### Example 1
Input: stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the value of the last stone.

### Example 2
Input: stones = [1]
Output: 1

## Constraints
- 1 <= stones.length <= 30
- 1 <= stones[i] <= 1000

## Hints
- Simulate the process.  We can do it with a heap, or by sorting some list of stones every time we take a turn.
